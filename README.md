TomatoBag
=========

TomatoBag is a simple app that allows you to browse upcoming and new dvd releases and "bag" then to your wanted list.  The idea is that with the increasing popularity of cord cutting, people are watching more movies from netflix, iTunes, and, ahem, elsewhere.  

So, the next time you're sitting down on the weekend and you're asked, "So, what should we watch?", just check  your TomatoBag!

## Installation

In order to use TomatoBag, you'll need a developer key from [rotten tomatoes](developer.rottentomatoes.com).  Set that as an environment variable in your shell (or use a tool you see fit):
   
    export ROTTEN_TOMATOES_API_KEY=[your key]
